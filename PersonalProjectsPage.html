                            A simple visual Novel Game developed using Unity Studio. The primary goal of the game is to 
                            tell the story of a young student and its school life. The player take control of a main 
                            character, see the story unfold through that character's first-person perspective and 
                            make decisions for them throughout the story. This is our Final Project for our Subject 
                            Game Development during our 3rd year 1st term in STI College General Santos.
